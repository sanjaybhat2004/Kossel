List of Common Ligands,"X-,H2O,OH-,CH3CN,py,NCS-,NO2-,PPh3,CN-,CO,en,bpy,phen,EDTA,ox,acac",,Comma seperate,2
Write the reaction of CoCl2 anhydrous with Water,CoCl2(blue)+H2O->CoCl2.6H2O(magenta),,,0
Octahedral eg's contituent orbitals,"dz2, dx2-y2",stronger interaction with ligand centres,Comma seperate,2
Octahedral t2g's contituent orbitals,"dxy,dyz,dxz",Least interaction with ligand centres. Same for e and t2 of tetrahedal except t2 is of higher energy.,Comma seperate,2
g in t2g and eg stands for,gerade,"Gerade's wavefunction will be even in nature. It will have a centre of inversion. Sq Planar also has this, but tetrahedral doesnt",,

Common ligands in descending order of splitting,"CO=CN-,PPh3, NO2-, phen, bipy, en, NH3, py, CH3CN, NCS-, H2O=Ox,OH-,F-,Cl-,NCS-,Br-,I-",,"Incase of NCS-, type NCS- for both N donor and S donor. Comma seperate.",3
Incase of several absorption lines ________ is taken for splitting calculations,least energy line,,least energy line/highest energy line,
▲t/▲o,4/9,"Apparently one 2/3 because 4 ligands instead of 6. And 2/3 for approaching from corners instead of face centres. Since this is so less, high spin is more common in tetrahedral & if really strong ligands are there pairing happens and geometry changes to square planar (common in d8)",,1
Magnetic Moment in terms of total spin (s),2sqrt(s(s+1)),sqrt(n(n+2)) = sqrt(2s(2s+2)) = 2sqrt(s(s+2)) where n is the number of unpaired,,1
Splitting strength in ascending order of metal centres,"Mn(II),Ni(II),Co(II),Fe(III),Cr(III),Co(III),Ru(III),Mo(III),Rh(III),Pd(II),Ir(III),Pt(IV)",Smaller ones split more because of more repulsions. Higher charged split stronger because of better interactions,,3
▲sp/▲o,1.3,,,1
3d series,"Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn",First 3 usually make deficient comps. Next 3 are usually 18 e. Next two are either 18 or 16. The 16 are sq planar.,,3
