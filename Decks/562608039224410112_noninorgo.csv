S8+KOH->,K2S2O3+K2S+H2O,"Regular hydrolysis starts. Just like P4 even though bond isnt polar, assymetric hydrolysis starts ...-S-H + HO-S-... ; but then breaking the non polar bond in the other side too becomes difficult. So on the second nucleophilic attack instead of breaking the bond, S expands octet and makes (HO)2-S=S + K-S-... and breaks bond at the other side. Now the unstable intermediates KS-SK and S=S-(OH)2 +KOH redox to give H2S2O3 and K2S. ",,

Wavelength Range for Tyndall Effect with Colloids,>10^-9,"1. Colloidal Size. Tyndall Scattering needs wavelength larger than particle size to scatter. \n 2. Its just anologous to Rayleigh Scatter, demands that refractive index of particle and medium are greatly different (In victinity of particle, permittivity is obviously different since if not, then there wont be any electric field effects and so sqrt(eµ) is also different.) \n 3.

Acidity order (Desc.),"HI, H2SO4, HX, RSO3H, H3O, RCOOH, HCO3, ArEH, RNH3, H2O, ROH, H2, RCHO",Aromatic OH with 1 or more NO2 like deactivation will come higher than HCO3. Aliphatic with 3 beta Hyperconj. or 2 NO2 will also come above HCO3. Amides won't dissolve in HCl unlike Amines.,Include conjugate acids of bases but don't notate charges. Position of HNO3 is disputed thus don't include it. Use E for O/N. Assume conjugate acid of Hydride is H2,3
