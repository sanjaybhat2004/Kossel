H,,
HgCO3+▲->,2Hg+O2+2CO2,"Unlike regular decompositions, HgCO3 directly goes to Hg because HgO decomp temperature is pretty low too. Same with nitrates. Generally, Pyrolysis are driven by ppt-ing or gas-ing."
Na2CO3+▲->,no rxn,Alkali metal carbonates (ex. Li by diagonal rel) are thermally stable
HNO3+▲->,H2O+NO2+O2,"Note that same reaction happens in oxidation half. N2O5 (Has an N-O-N bond, it is the anhydride of acid not exactly a nitrogenoxide) wants to become NO2 and NO3 but NO3 is unstable. Generally, Pyrolysis are driven by ppt-ing or gas-ing."
H2SO4+▲(extreme)->,H2O+SO2+O2,"Note that same reaction happens in oxidation half. Generally, Pyrolysis are driven by ppt-ing or gas-ing. When SO4 is the oxidizer it goes to SO2, When SO4 is being *reduced* it goes to S--."
(COOH)2+▲->,H2O+CO+CO2,"First decarbox at one side, and then how AcOH on dehydration, CO is given. Generally, Pyrolysis are driven by ppt-ing or gas-ing."
NH4IO3+▲->,N2+I2+O2+4H2O,"If anion is oxidizing, NH3 is oxidized. I2 and Cl2 are not oxidizing per se, so Cl- and I- are not formed unless N2 was reducing in nature. Generally, Pyrolysis are driven by ppt-ing or gas-ing."
NH4NO3+▲->,N2O+2H2O,"Exceptionally N2O is formed instead of N2 because this isnt redox although anion is oxidizing, this is just literally removing H2O to give :kekw:-gas. Generally, Pyrolysis are driven by ppt-ing or gas-ing."
NH4NO2+▲->,N2+2H2O,"Unlike typical NO2 decomp, this exceptionally goes through NH4NO3 decomposition. Generally, Pyrolysis are driven by ppt-ing or gas-ing."
(NH4)2HPO4+▲->,H3P3O9+NH3+H2O,"All NH4 bonds are replaced with anhydride links, OH unaffected with pure NH3 and H case. Generally, Pyrolysis are driven by ppt-ing or gas-ing."
Na(NH4)HPO4+▲->,Na3P3O9+NH3+H2O,"All NH4 bonds are replaced with anhydride links, OH are also touched when theres a better metal around. Metal bonds are unaffected and H-P are also unaffected. Generally, Pyrolysis are driven by ppt-ing or gas-ing."
NaNO3+▲->,NaNO2+O2,"Unlike regular NO2-, Group I nitrites are stable similar to same stabilization that stabilizes peroxides and superoxides. Generally, Pyrolysis are driven by ppt-ing or gas-ing."
AuCl3+▲(mild)->,AuCl+Cl2,"Heating halides supports leaving of X2 even if bigger ox state is more stable if difference in stability is small enough. Generally, Pyrolysis are driven by ppt-ing or gas-ing"
MCl2.2H2O+▲->,MO+HCl+H2O,Hydrated chloride salts are actually complexes and Cl leaves easier than O in some H2O->M. This is for Sn(II) Mg Fe Al Zn Cu
KOAc+▲->,K2CO3+CH3COCH3,"Group I carbonates are stable and won't break further. Decarbox does not happen as there is not driving force here unlike beta carbonyl in oxalate. Generally, Pyrolysis are driven by ppt-ing or gas-ing."
H2SO3+▲->,H2SO4+S8(ppt)+H2O,"Acids not at their ortho ox state or mineral form disproportionate simply because the extremes are more stable than others. Generally, Pyrolysis are driven by ppt-ing or gas-ing which is S8 here. Mild heating gives H2O+SO2, on extreme heating SO2 reacts further with H2SO3."
HOCl+▲->,HCl+HClO3,Acids not at their ortho ox state or mineral form disproportionate simply because the extremes are more stable than others.
HClO3+▲->,HClO4+ClO2+H2O,"Cl2O5+H2O. This is already at ortho ox state, this reaction is more similar to HNO2-> N2O5. Generally, Pyrolysis are driven by ppt-ing or gas-ing."
H3PO2+▲->,H3PO4+PH3,"Acids not at their ortho ox state or mineral form disproportionate simply because the extremes are more stable than others. Generally, Pyrolysis are driven by ppt-ing or gas-ing."
Ag2C2O4+▲->,Ag+CO2,"Although Ag2O+CO+CO2 is expected like in AgCO3, Ag2O + CO -> Ag + CO2. Generally, Pyrolysis are driven by ppt-ing or gas-ing."
LiCl.2H2O+▲->,LiCl+H2O,Not all hydrated chlorides become oxides
BeCl2.4H2O+▲->,Be(OH)2+HCl,Exceptional
