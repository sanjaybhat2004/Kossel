The pair that has similar atomic radii is (a) Mn and Re (b) Ti and Hf (c) Sc and Ni (d) Mo and W,d,"The pair that has similar atomic radii is Mo and W. It is due to lanthanoid contraction. The factor responsible for lanthanoid contraction is the imperfect shielding of one electron by another in the same set of orbitals. Shielding of 4 f is very less due to its diffused shape. As a result, nuclear charge increases. Hence, Mo and W have similar atomic radii",

"The lanthanide ion that would show colour is (2019 Main, 8 April I) (a) Gd 3+ (b) Sm 3+ (c) La 3+ (d) Lu 3+",b,The lanthanide ion that would show colour is Sm 3+ . Colour of a compound depends on the number of electrons in 4 f-orbitals. Electronic configuration of given lanthanides are as follows: Gd 3+ = 4 7 f Sm 3+ = 4 5 f La 3+ = 4 0 f Lu 3+ = 4 f 14 Gd 3+ have half-filled 4 f-orbitals. La 3+ have no electron in 4 f-orbitals. Lu 3+ have fully-filled 4 f-orbitals. Only Sm 3+ contain 4 5 f . The electrons can easily undergoes excitation. That result in a formation of colour,

The correct order of atomic radii is Note (i) N being the member of p-block and second period, have the smallest radii. (ii) Rest of all the 3 members are lanthanides with Eu having stable half-filled configuration thus with bigger size than rest two. (iii) Among Ce and Ho, Ce has larger size which can be explained on the basis of âLanthanoid contractionâ.",

achieve most stable +3 oxidation state.",
"The 71 st electron of an element X with an atomic number of 71 enters into the orbital (2019 Main, 10 Jan II) (a) 4 f (b) 6p (c) 5d (d) 6s",c,"In the lanthanoid se ries, atomic num ber of four teen 4 f-block el e ments ranges from 58 (Ce) to 71 (Lu). Ytterbium, Yb(Z = 70) has electronic configuration : [Xe] 4 6 14 2 f s . So, the 71nth electron of lutetium, Lu(Z = 71) should enter into 5d orbital and its (here, Lu is âXâ) electronic configuration will be : [Xe]4 5 6 14 1 2 f d s .
