Test for CN-,CN+FeSO4+H2SO4(conc)->Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3(Prussian Blue),"Used in Lasagne's organic tests. First complex is formed by Fe2+, then Fe2+ in solution is oxidized by concentrated H2SO4.

Nessler's Reagant Preparation,HgI2+KI->K2[HgI4],,,
NO3- Confirmatory,NO3+H2SO4+FeSO4->[Fe(H2O)5NO](brown ring),"[H+] creates a condition similar to HNO3 and NO2 is oxidized by HNO3 to NO. NO has an unpaired electron in antibonding and readily donates it to Fe2+ (unlike how Nitroso is formed in diazonium formation). Fe is exceptionally +1 here. This doesnt need concentrated acid unlike NO2-- because these acid must to reduction and it wont disproportionate(not exactly, but qualitatively) like here",Ignore byproducts for this reaction,
