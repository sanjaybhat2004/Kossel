CCl4+H2O(drastic conditions),COCl2+2HCl,SN1 happens only in drastic conditions. Carbene is formed which then reacts with nucleophilic OH-,,
NF3+H2O->,no rxn,Under nondrastic conditions SN1 cant happen. SN2 will need low lying empty orbital for flank attack which is absent.,,
2HNO2(g)->,NO2+NO+H2O,N2O3 + H2O,,
3SiF4+4H2O->,Si(OH)4+2H2[SiF6],SiF4 being highly dq+ and empty d orbital readily complexes into d2sp3. This happens only with F-,,
4BF3+3H2O->,H3BO3+3H[BF4],"BF3 being deficient, readily gets complexated to get an octet. This happens only with F- and OH-",Write product in acid form,
BCl3+NaOH->,3NaCl+Na[B(OH)4],"Similar to BF3 complexation, Surplus of OH- in solution will complexate deficient molecule.  Same happens with BeCl2, it is a deficient yet small atom too",,
NCl3+3H2O->,NH3+3HOCl,"N is more EN than Cl and OH attacks Cl, not N",,
SbCl3+H2O->,SbOCl(ppt)+2HCl,Sb has +3 charge since this is ionic and its solubility is bad because of size of Sb,,
