Wavelength Range for Tyndall Effect with Colloids,>10^-9,"1. Colloidal Size. Tyndall Scattering needs wavelength larger than particle size to scatter. \n 2. Its just anologous to Rayleigh Scatter, demands that refractive index of particle and medium are greatly different (In victinity of particle, permittivity is obviously different since if not, then there wont be any electric field effects and so sqrt(eµ) is also different.) \n 3. Just like Rayleigh scattering, Smaller lambda are more affected by µ and hence more scattered.
